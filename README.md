# Traffic Slide

My submission to the Flutter Puzzle Hack Challenge

## Project description
I wanted to build a more dynamic game then just a normal slide puzzle, so I had an eye on the game element of the police chase
and wanted to implement something similar into my slide puzzle based game. The result is what you can see here. 

A race car escapes the police, and gets hindered by traffic, which has to be removed by the player. If the player does this fast enough the race car may escape!
